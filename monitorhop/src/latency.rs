//! Background per-address latency prober.
//!
//! A multi-homed peer (e.g. a laptop with both a wired and a Wi-Fi
//! address on the same subnet) exposes several candidate IPs. To let
//! the user pick *which* interface to lock, the GUI shows the measured
//! round-trip latency next to each address — including the ones we are
//! **not** currently connected on. Those inactive candidates have no
//! live connection to read an RTT from, so this module actively probes
//! every candidate on a slow cadence.
//!
//! ## Why a TCP connect probe
//!
//! monitorhop's data path is DTLS-over-UDP and it does not run a TCP
//! listener, so a probe connect to `(ip, port)` normally elicits an
//! immediate TCP RST ("connection refused") from a reachable peer. The
//! refusal round-trip still measures the layer-3 path latency — which
//! is exactly the signal the user needs to tell a ~0.8 ms wired link
//! from a ~70 ms Wi-Fi one — without privileges (no raw ICMP) and
//! without disturbing the live DTLS session. A host that is down or
//! firewalled yields a timeout, surfaced as "unreachable".
//!
//! Structure mirrors [`crate::dns::DnsResolver`]: a `spawn_local` task
//! owns the cadence and ships [`ProbeResult`]s back over a
//! single-threaded channel that [`crate::service`] selects on.
